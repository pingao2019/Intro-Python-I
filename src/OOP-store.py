# Let's go ahead and add a different ID to each department 

# To do this, we could change the departments list to a dict 

# so that we can have the ID as key and name as value 

# Or, we could have the departments list store tuples, where each 

# tuple has the name and ID 

​

# Why tuples vs dicts for this representation 

# departments = [

#     ("Running", 101),

#     ("Fishing", 103),

#     ("Baseball", 45), 

#     ("Basketball", 87)

# ]

# We can now easily look up a department by its ID 

# departments[103] => "Fishing"

# So we get efficient lookup for our departments 

departments = {

    101: Department(101, "Running", [Clothing("Running Shorts", 15, "Cotton", "Black")]),

    103: Department(103, "Fishing", [Equipment("Rod", 200, 1, "Fishing")]),

    45: Department(45, "Baseball", [Equipment("Bat", 50, 2, "Baseball")]),

    87: Department(87, "Basketball", [Equipment("Bat", 50, 2, "Baseball")]),

}

my_store = Store("The Dugout", departments)

​

# add a way for a user to select departments

print(my_store)

selection = int(input("Select a department number: "))

​

# Change this so that we're accessing Departments from the "canonical" list

# of Departments 

print(f"You selected Department {selection}, {my_store.departments[selection].get_name()}")

print("Products in this Department: ")

my_store.departments[selection].print_products()

​

# There's no easy way to access some department "outside" of our Store class 

​

# Let's add a more streamlined way to add Departments to our Store 

# Let's add a methon on the Department class that will take in a list of Strings

# representing Department names, and create the Department instances for us.
