# Change this so that we're accessing Departments from the "canonical" list
# of Departments 
print(f"You selected Department {selection}, {my_store.departments[selection-1].get_name()}")

# There's no easy way to access some department "outside" of our Store class 

# Let's add a more streamlined way to add Departments to our Store 
# Let's add a methond on the Department class that will take in a list of Strings
# representing Department names, and create the Department instances for us.
